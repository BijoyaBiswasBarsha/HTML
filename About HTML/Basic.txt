HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
A markup language is a set of markup tags
HTML documents are described by HTML tags
Each HTML tag describes different document content







Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines this document to be HTML5
The text between <html> and </html> describes an HTML document
The text between <head> and </head> provides information about the document
The text between <title> and </title> provides a title for the document
The text between <body> and </body> describes the visible page content
The text between <h1> and </h1> describes a heading
The text between <p> and </p> describes a paragraph
Using this description, a web browser will display a document with a heading and a paragraph.





HTML Documents
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

Styling HTML with CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in separate CSS files. However, here we will use inline and internal styling, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.




Chapter Summary
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address

HTML Links - The target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window

HTML Links - Colors
When you move the mouse over a link, two things will normally happen:

The mouse arrow will turn into a little hand
The color of the link element will change
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
You can change the default colors, by using styles:

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>
The <div> Element

This JavaScript example writes "Hello JavaScript!" into an HTML element with id="demo":





The HTML <head> Element
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.

The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

The HTML <title> Element
The <title> element defines the title of the document, and is required in all HTML/XHTML documents.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser tab

What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).

Responsive Web Design is about using CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen:



Using W3.CSS
Another way to create a responsive design, is to use a responsive style sheet, like W3.CSS

W3.CSS makes it easy to develop sites that look nice at any size; desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone:
